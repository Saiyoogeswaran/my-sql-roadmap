# 📊 SQL Learning Journey by Sai

Welcome to my structured SQL learning archive—crafted over months of self-study, experimentation, and hands-on practice. This repository reflects my transition into the world of data analytics, starting from scratch and learning through free resources that made a big difference.

## 🎓 Learning Sources

All materials were learned through publicly available and free platforms:

- **Alex The Analyst** – YouTube tutorials & exercises (Beginner to Intermediate SQL)
- **Chandoo** – Blog-style SQL challenges and case-based examples

These creators helped me build a strong foundation in query logic, joins, subqueries, window functions, and performance-oriented SQL design.
